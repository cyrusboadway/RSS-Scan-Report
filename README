Application Purpose
-------------------

The application/script, called periodically, will fetch an RSS feed
URL and check {title, author, comments} for matches with a set
of regular expressions. Upon a match, it will send an email
notice about the feed match.

My Purpose
----------

I made this to become more familiar with GitHub, and to brush off the rust
on my Python (four spaces?). If someone finds this trivial piece of code
useful, great! Also, this is the third time I've written this script, and
since it was so trivial, I never thought to back it up outside of my OS
patition, disappearing every format.
It'll be safe in the cloud. Right? Right?!

Technology
----------

* cron - this script is not a background service. It must be executed
         periodically by an external service, like cron.
* SQLite - to maintain a list of previous matches in order to prevent
           duplicate emails, a database is maintained in SQLlite. SQLlite
           is under Public Domain.
* DynamoDB - perhaps as an alternative (and as an intersting "let's
             explore new technologies" project) this'll provide the
             database. In AWS were critical, I suppose SimpleDB would
             be better, but that's hardly why I'm doing this project.

License

For the time being, this application is licensed as WTFPL
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). Modify, redistrubute, do as you like.
This might change after I check out the DynamoDB wrappers.
